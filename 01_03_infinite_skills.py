Someting I've always wanted to do If I had the skills too was make my own website.
Not a social media page or website using a boring template from another website.
But my own website I made with my own five fingers having coded and designed everything.
I'd like to have a place that I can just have everything I've made be on without worry of it going away.
All my music, comics, really stupid ideas, art, all of it.
