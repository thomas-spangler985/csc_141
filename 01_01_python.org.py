I really like and appreciate how many reasources given to help new coders are available.
Not even behind a pay-wall too, all the guides, videos, and FAQ's are just right there when I need them.
I also think its really cool that it has a whole dedicated section for events going on.
But what super cool about is that its not just corparate meetings or American focused, it covers everything all over the world!
Like Right now it has conventions and meet up's listed in places like Brazil, India, the Netherlands and even Estonia!
I dont even know where that one is on a map! Its just super cool to me how open Python is to helping and promoting others
